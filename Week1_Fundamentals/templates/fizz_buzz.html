            Game Rules:<br>
            * If the number is divisible by 5, the person doesn't say the number, instead, they say "Fizz!".<br>
            * Also, if the number contains a 5, the player must say "Fizz!".<br>
            * if the number contains a 7 or is divisible by 7, they must say "Buzz!".<br>
            * These fizzes and buzzes combine together - for example, instead of 35, I would say "Fizz, fizz, buzz!", because the number contains a 5, is divisible by 5, and is divisible by 7.<br>
